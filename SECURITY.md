# Security Policy

## Supported Branches

We currently only audit and monitor the `main` branch for security vulnerabilities.

All feature development should be merged into `main` through pull requests and go through standard review.

If you're contributing, please make sure your changes pass static analysis and security checks on the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it directly to me:

https://github.com/ArnoldSchiller
schiller@babsi.de

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it (if possible)
- The impact and any suggested fix

We aim to respond as soon as possible.

## Third-party Dependencies

This project uses third-party libraries. We do our best to keep them up-to-date in the `main` branch.

Dependency updates in other branches may not be reviewed until they are merged into `main`.
